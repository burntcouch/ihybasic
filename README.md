# Woz inspried Integer BASIC port to Hydra-16

This is based off the Integer BASIC disasembly I discovered [here](https://6502disassembly.com/a2-rom/IntegerBASIC.html).

Caveats:  as of 2/11/26 I have NOT run this on the Hydra yet.  Since there are only 3 extant Hydra-16 machines in existence as of this date, might not be of much use to you yet, but....Build one!

In any case....more when I know more.  You can burn this to a 8K or larger ROM, map it to $A000 on a 6502 memory space, and it may work!
